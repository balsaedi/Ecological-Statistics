For instance the mean concentration of a chemical contaminant in a soil sample of a contaminated site. Here, the data sample is the soil sample that was taken to the laboratory to find out the mean concentration of the contaminant while the data population is the entire data population consisting of all possible soil measurements of the chemical contaminant at the site. We need to define some terms to get this clear. Data Population: is the entire set of individuals, items or observations of interest in a study. For instance all the soil samples from the contaminant site. Data Sample: is the subset of the population selected for analysis. For example, measuring the height of randomly selected trees in the forest. Data Distribution: describes how data points are spread of arranged. Data Sample vs Data Population A deep understanding of the difference between data sample and data population is important in inferential statistics which seeks to generalize the results of data analyses performed on the data samples. A data population consists of all possible observations or data points concerning the characteristic of interest. For instance, when finding out the mean height of all the oak trees in a forest, the data population will be every height of every single oak tree in the forest. Contrary, data sample is usually a limited subset of observations drawn for the entire population. In this case we can have a data sample by randomly selecting 100 oak trees and measuring their heights. Try it! Lets simulate data of oak trees with R # Seed for reproducibility set.seed(123) # A population of 12500 oak trees population_heights &lt;- rnorm(12500, mean = 20, sd=5) head(population_heights) ## [1] 17.19762 18.84911 27.79354 20.35254 20.64644 28.57532 We have simulated the heights of 12500 oak trees in a forest. The variance population_heights represent the data population for the oak tree heights. Lets randomly select 86 trees from the entire data population of oak tree heights # Randomly select 86 trees sample_heights &lt;- sample(population_heights, size=86, replace = FALSE) tail(sample_heights) ## [1] 25.88792 29.03996 29.00965 37.10547 17.76631 19.81021 The variable sample_heights represents data sample for the oak tree heights. If we make this experiment more interesting, we find the mean and standard deviation for the data population and the data sample for the oak tree heights. Lets do it! # Mean and standard deviation of the entire population population_stats &lt;- c( Mean = mean(population_heights), SD = sd(population_heights) ) population_stats ## Mean SD ## 19.995609 4.996295 The entire oak tree data population has a mean height of approximately 20 meters and a standard deviation of approx 5 meters. Lets see how it compares with the data sample of the oak tree heights. # Mean and standard deviation of the sample sample_stats &lt;- c( Mean = mean(sample_heights), SD = sd(sample_heights) ) sample_stats ## Mean SD ## 21.094995 5.507379 There is a minor difference between the data sample and the entire data population of the oak tree heights. As you can see the selected sample of oak trees has an average height of 21 meters and a standard deviation of 5.5 meters. Practical Exercise Run the code below to generate the data of soil samples collected in farm with livestock. The main objective was to find the pH of the soil.

The sample mean is slightly higher than the whole population mean while the standard deviation of the whole populations is almost equal to the data sample’s standard deviation ________________________________________________________________________________ 1.1 Data Distributions Data Distribution describes how data values in data population are spread across the range of possible values. For instance, in our case the height of oak trees in the forest might be distributed normally, meaning that most trees cluster around the average height. Understanding data distribution is crucial in ecological analysis since it helps in; identifying patterns ( for instance seasonal changes in bird populations). choosing appropriate statistical tests. modelling ecological phenomena accurately. When dealing with continuous data values like height of oak trees, soil acidity or rainfall, Probability Distribution Functions is used to find the likelihood of different outcomes in a population. There are two types of probability distribution functions, namely; Cumulative distribution function, Empirical Cumulative distribution function. Below is the distribution of oak tree heights represented in a density plot. library(ggplot2) # Create a data frame from the data oak_df &lt;- data.frame(Height = population_heights) # Plot the density plot ggplot(oak_df, aes(x = Height)) + geom_density(fill = &quot;blue&quot;, alpha=0.5) + labs( title = &quot;Distribution of tree heights&quot;, x = &quot;Tree Height(m)&quot;, y = &quot;Density&quot; ) + theme_minimal() Above is the distribution of oak tree heights, lets find its probability using the two types of distribution functions. Cumulative Distribution Function This distribution function leans toward that a probability of a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value. 1.2 Hands-on Exercises Solution ________________________________________________________________________________ "],["hypothesis-testing.html", "Chapter 2 HYPOTHESIS TESTING 2.1 Introduction 2.2 Hands-on Exercise", " Chapter 2 HYPOTHESIS TESTING 2.1 Introduction Hypothesis testing is a standard statistical procedure for deciding between two competing alternatives or scenarios, based on evidence presented by a data sample collected for the purpose of conducting the test. Most descriptive statistics such as mean, median and standard deviation are usually computed from data samples which may vary with the whole population mean. For instance, we want to find the concentration of hexavalent chromium, a human carcinogen, in soil. We will collect random 20 samples. The average concentration of the carcinogen from the collected samples will at most vary with the average concentration in the entire land, that’s where hypothesis testing comes in. Basic terminology and procedure for hypothesis testing There is a need to understand the basic terms before diving deep into the process of hypothesis testing. If we have historical data, the presence of a trend must be established and below are the assumptions that should be made prior to conducting hypothesis testing; The data is assumed to belong to a specified distribution(typically normal distribution). The data has a stable or stationary trend(from of temporal or spatial trend). There are no unusual observations or outliers. The hypothesis testing that is based on the above is described as parametric hypothesis testing. Otherwise, if the above assumptions are not met, the test is known as non-parametric hypothesis testing. Null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)): Is a statement of the presumed default or baseline condition. In this case the null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the carcinogenic concentration is below the allowed limit. Alternate hypothesis (\\(H_1\\) or \\(H_A\\)): is the inverse or the opposite of the null hypothesis. Alternate hypothesis contradicts the statement of the presumed default. In this case, the alternate hypothesis states that the carcinogenic level is above the allowed limit. The evidence produced by the sample after conducting hypothesis testing can either refute or support the null hypothesis. The one-tailed (One-Sided) Hypothesis test checks for an effect in only one direction. In our case, we test if the carcinogen levels exceed the allowed limit(right side). Alternatively, it can be checked of it is below the allowed limits (left-sided). Upper-Tailed Hypothesis Test is the same as the right one-tailed hypothesis test that checks if the value of interest exceed the null hypothesis value Lower-Tailed Hypothesis Test is the left one-tailed hypthesis test where it checks if the value of interest is below the null hypothesis value. In our case the allowed limit for carcinogens in soil. Two-Tailed Hypothesis Test checks for the effect in both directions. In our we can change to find if the carcinogen levels are below or above the allowed limit. T-Value is the test statistic calculated from the sample data to determine how far the sample mean is from the hypothesized mean, in terms of standard error. Critical T-Value is the threshold value for the t-distribution that corresponds to the significance level. If the t-value exceeds the critical t-value, the null hypothesis is rejected. _______add sample code for explanation ____________ Significant level(\\(\\alpha\\)) is the probability threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis, usually set to 0.05(5%). In most cases if the probability of observing the test statistic (p-value) is less than 0.005, the null hypothesis is rejected. Degrees of Freedom(df) are the number of independent values in the data sample that are free to vary when calculationg a statistic. In most cases df is calculated as \\[df = n - 1\\] where \\(n\\) represents the sample size(count). In our cases where we have 20 samples therefore \\(df = 20 -1\\) and the degree of freedom will be 19 P-Value indicates the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the observed one, assuming the null hypothesis is true. Below are the steps taken in hypothesis testing; Formulate the null and alternate hypothesis. Assume the null hypothesis is true and compute a test statistic that follows a known distribution. Compute a critical value of a known distribution. * Continue from here____________________* 2.2 Hands-on Exercise Solution ________________________________________________________________________________ "],["test-for-autocorrelation-and-temporal-effects.html", "Chapter 3 TEST FOR AUTOCORRELATION AND TEMPORAL EFFECTS", " Chapter 3 TEST FOR AUTOCORRELATION AND TEMPORAL EFFECTS "],["correlation-covariance-geostatistics.html", "Chapter 4 CORRELATION, COVARIANCE, GEOSTATISTICS", " Chapter 4 CORRELATION, COVARIANCE, GEOSTATISTICS "],["linear-regression-analysis.html", "Chapter 5 LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS", " Chapter 5 LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS "],["conventional-and-probabilistic-risk-assessment.html", "Chapter 6 CONVENTIONAL AND PROBABILISTIC RISK ASSESSMENT", " Chapter 6 CONVENTIONAL AND PROBABILISTIC RISK ASSESSMENT "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
